# 🧠 So Which One Should You Use?

- # Use Introsort (sort) when:M

- You want speed and efficiency
- Stability is not required
- You're sorting primitive types or simple structures

- # Use Merge Sort (stable_sort) when:

- You need stable sorting
- You're sorting complex objects (e.g., structs with multiple fields)
- You’re okay with extra memory usage
