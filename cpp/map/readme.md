# 🌳 What is std::map?

- A sorted associative container that stores key–value pairs.
- Keys are unique (no duplicates).
- Internally implemented as a balanced binary search tree (usually Red-Black Tree).
- Provides logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for insertion, deletion, and search.

# 🔑 Key Features

- Ordered: Keys are stored in sorted order (default: ascending).
- Unique keys: No duplicate keys allowed.
- Efficient search: find() and count() work in O(log n).
