C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that also provides low-level features. Here’s a breakdown to make it clear:

# 🧩 Key Characteristics of C++ 

- Compiled language: Code is translated into machine instructions by a compiler before execution, making it fast and efficient.
- Multi-paradigm: Supports different programming styles:
- Procedural programming (like C)
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- Generic programming with templates
- Functional programming aspects (lambdas, higher-order functions)
- Statically typed: Types are checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- Low-level capabilities: Allows direct memory manipulation with pointers, making it close to hardware.
- Portable: Runs on many platforms with minimal changes.

# ⚡ Why it’s unique

C++ is often called a middle-level language because it blends:
- High-level features (abstraction, classes, libraries)
- Low-level control (manual memory management, direct hardware interaction)
