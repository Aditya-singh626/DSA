1. Binary Number System (Base 2)
- Digits used: 0 and 1
- Fundamental to computers (because hardware uses ON/OFF states).
- Example:
- Decimal 5 = Binary 101

2. Octal Number System (Base 8)
- Digits used: 0–7
- Was historically used in older systems because it maps neatly to binary (3 bits = 1 octal digit).
- Example:
- Decimal 64 = Octal 100

3. Decimal Number System (Base 10)
- Digits used: 0–9
- The system humans use daily.
- Computers often convert binary results into decimal for us to read.
- Example:
- Binary 1010 = Decimal 10

4. Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)
- Digits used: 0–9 and A–F (where A=10, B=11, … F=15).
- Widely used in programming for:
- Memory addresses
- Machine code
- Color codes in web design
- Example:
- Decimal 255 = Hex FF
