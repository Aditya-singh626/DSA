🧩 Memory Addresses in Programming
- When you give input (say through cin in C++ or scanf in C), the value is stored in a variable.
- Every variable in memory has an address (location in RAM).
- That address is represented as a hexadecimal number because:
- Hexadecimal (base 16) is compact and easier for humans to read than binary.
- Memory is fundamentally binary, but hex maps neatly (4 bits = 1 hex digit).
- Example: Instead of writing 1010111100001010, we can write AF0A.
